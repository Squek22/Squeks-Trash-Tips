    <p><h3>So you want to make a trap..?</h3></p>
    <hr>
    <p> There's a lot that goes into a trap, and it depends on what kind of trap you are wanting to be...</p>
    <p> Do you want to be a solo trap? <br> A rally Trap? <br><br><br>
         These are the questions to ask yourself before you even load a new account, honestly. <br> A lot of factors can
        play into whether or not you can succeed as a solo or rally trap, and it starts from the begining.</p>
    <p>Trapping in Lords Mobile is very fun, but can also be very stressful, the reward is great though. The main things you need to look at when you begin to make a trap is how much you want to spend, how you're going to obtain everything you <em>need</em> and what kind of trap you're going to be..</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><u><strong>Solo Traps</strong></u></p>
    <p>Solo Traps are generally aroound 100M Might to 200M Might, <em>but</em> can be as high as 250M-300M depending on the Kingdom you are in and the targets you're looking for..</p>
    <br><p>The main goal of a solo trap is to cap leaders, of course. Unlike a rally trap though, there's generally no way you'll be able to safely go into Battle Fury, unless you have the gear to hold up to a few rallies.</p>  
    <p>The nice part about a solo trap, is you have less troops <em>generally</em>to worry about healing. If you run full infirmaries you can typically hold a hit or two in your beds. Personally though, I would run half and half with manors and infirmaries.</p>
