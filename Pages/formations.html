    <p><h2>Let's Learn some formations...</h2></p>
    <p>There are two types of formations in Lords Mobile. You have Phalanx, and you have Wedge. There is Infantry, Range and Cavalry formations for each,
        however, don't let the names mislead you. If you attack with Cavalary, for example, you don't want to be in a Cavalry formation, <em>generally..</em></p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Phalanx</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Infantry Phalanx</li>
        <p>Four Squads on Infantry on the front line. With two rows of Two Cavalary Squads behind it, and finally a Line of 4 Ranged Squads. Infantry Phalanx is great for defending against Ranged Rallies, and can be good to attack with Range, or Cavalary Troops.</p>
        <li>Range Phalanx</li>
        <p>Four Squads of Ranged on the front line, with two rows of two Infantry squads making up the mid line, follow by Cavalry. Ranged Phalanx is great for defending against Cavalry Rallies, and the go to Wonder Formation based on the way troops move in the formation. Ranged Phalanxe can also be great for attacking with Cavalry.</p>
        <li>Cavalry Phalanx</li>
        <p>Four Squads of Cavalry make up the front line, followed by two lines of two Ranged Squads in the mid line, and 4 Infantry squads making up the back line. Cav Phalanx can be good for defending against Infantry Rallies, and can be good for attacking with Infantry.</p>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p><h4>Wedge</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infantry Wedge</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Ranged Wedge</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cavalary Wedge</li>
        <p></p>
        </ul>

        <h5>Which Formation to Use for What?</h5>
        <p><h2>Attacking</h2></p>
        <p>In short, you want your main attacking troops the the rear of your formation. Typically we call the non main troops <strong>"Buffers"</strong>. They function as a buffer between the defending troops and our attacking troops. </p>
        <h3>Why buffers??</h3>
        <p>The main significance of buffers if to try to do two thinkgs. First you want to try to trick the defending troops and give your main troops more of a chance to do damage. Tied in with that, you want the buffers to take the initial hits, and let your full force do the most damage possible.</p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Let's take a look.</h5>
        <img src="PLACE HOLDER" alt="Ranged Wedge Formation">
        <p>If we look at Ranged Wedge, it looks to be great for attacking with Infantry. Range troops are in the front, with Cavalare behind it, and then your Infantry squads. Granted, you will have small <strong>Ranged</strong> and <Strong> Cavalary</Strong> squads, but remember, they are <em>buffers</em> 
            As the troops move towards the target in <strong>Ranged Wedge</strong>, the range troops will stop at the mid line and let the Cavalry run past, and then the Infantry will follow. So already your Range buffers are going to draw out the Infantry troops, and your Cavalry will start to attack them, letting your Infantry troops run in and hit your main targets.</p>
            <p>Each Formation functions differently, and it's important to understand how the troops move within each formation, in order to maximize your buffers(if you choose to use them) and get your troops to hit right.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Defending!</h5>
<p>Defending can be far easier than attacking, you look at your watch tower and see what is attacking you, and then put the troops that counter your attackers in front.<em>However,</em> as we know troops in formation can move differently, we must understand that certain formations function differently than advertised.</p>
<h3><p>Looking back at Ranged Wedge...</p></h3>
<p>We talked about how the troops move in Ranged Wedge, so we must understand how this formation functions when it comes to defending as well. Ranged Wedge can argueably be the best formation to sleep in if you're afraid of being rallied while asleep, as well as taking multiple unknown rallies at once. The rest for this is as this.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Mid Line of Cav will work on the Infantry attackers if they send Infantry.</li>
    <li>The Back Line of Infnatry will work on the Range attackers, along with the fact that Range attacks against Range attacks can be significantly harder, due to the movement mechanics of the game.</li>
    <li>The Front Line of Range baits the attacking troops into the midline of the battle due to the way troops move and fight in the game</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>What is best?</h3>
<p>What is best is wildly dependant on your troop comps, your stats, familiars and research, and your comfort level. Along with whether or not you can take reins for defending. Having the knowledge to know what troops do what, in which formations is a huge foundational start to understand how things work in battle.</p>
