    <p><h3>What are wonder battles..?</h3></p>
    <hr>
    <div class="intro">
    <p>Wonders are the forts and bases on each kingdom map. They are controlled by a guild either in or out of the kingdom. However <strong>Note:</strong>That if you are the 'Overlord' Guild, and control the base, but are not in the kingdom, you won't have access to the any of the perks of being the ruling guild. However, if you control the attack and defense forts, and are out of kingrdom, you can still recieve the benefits of them. This is important, because you can take attack forts outside of your kingdom at the end of Kingdom Versus Kingdom(KVK), or before a Baron or Paladin event, and still keep the boosts.</p><hr></div>

    <div class="breakdown"></div><p><u>How to take a wonder</u><hr>Taking control of a wonder is a little more than just rallying it. You have to be able to not only win the attacks on the wonder, but you have to be able to defend it from further attacks until the battle period is over. This can be a troubling task at times, especially if your gear isn't as good as your opponents, however the big challenge with a wonder battle is the rally composition. Of course other things factor in, such as; 
        <ol>
            <li>Wonder Research</li>
            <li>Army Attack & Army HP</li>
            <li>Familiars and Heroes</li>
        </ol>

        <p> I won't go into great detail on all of those, because they are fairly straight forward, but I will go over each of them briefly.</p>
    <p><strong>Wonder Research</strong><hr>I would say Research, and wonder research specifically is the most important thing for winning wonder wars <em>after</em> gear and troops. The newer debuffs that were added in the Advanced Wonder Tree, as well as the additional amount of troops, and attack & health stats you can get, are crucial to closing the gap between you and the other leader. If you are an aspiring Wonder Rally Leader, this should be your research focus, however it is very tome expensive.</p>
    <p><strong>Army Stats</strong></p><p>Army Stats can be more important than individual troop stats when it comes to wonder wars. The reason for this is 1% Army Attack gives you 1% Infantry, Range and Cavalry attack. It's not to say you want <em>only</em> army stats, as if you do this you will have significantly less stats overall, however as you work more into Champion Gear, you will start to see more and more Army Attack and Army HP, which is critical to staying alive, and killing the enemy quicker.</p><hr>
    <p><strong>Familiars and Heroes</strong></p><p>This may be the most straight forward bit, however it may be unknown to many. Similarly to your stats, you want to have as many Army Attack and Army HP in your Wonder as you are able to. Lore Weaver, Berserker, Storm Fox  etc etc. This will give you the most split attack and HP as possible, to give you best the defenses. You also want the Wonder Heros (<em>These yield Turf Stats, so you don't have to deploy the hero to get the stats.</em>).</p><p>When it comes to familiars, like castle rallies, you want to have the Pact 5 Familiars in your wonders. They're going to give you the biggest damage yield, especially when you're defending. The more damage <em>you take</em> the more you'll do back to the enemy. Blackwing, Gargantua, Queen Bee, etc etc. Depending on what you're troop comp is for your wonder, will dictate which Familairs you deploy.</p></div>
