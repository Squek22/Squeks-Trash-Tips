    <p><h4>What does might even mean?</h4></p>

<hr>
<br>
<p>From the start of the game, you're almost instantly told that <u>Might = Power</u>. While that's not entirely incorrect, a lot of people <em>will</em> say it's not the way to think. Might does generally equate to how strong a castle is, <em>generally</em>. However there are some things that give you might, sometimes a lot, but give you no <em><strong><u>strength</u></strong></em>, these are some of them.
    <ul>
        <li>Turf Quests</li>
        <li>Buildings</li>
        <li>Empty Research</li>
    </ul>

<p><h3><u><strong>Turf Quests</strong></u></h3></p>
<p>Probably the quickest way to get levels, the quickest way to boost your might up to look stronger, and you can get a couple of speed ups or anima and resources from them in a pinch. However, Turf Quests are one of the biggest ways to gain "Empty Might". You gain no actual strength from completing a Turf Quest, but you gain might. The reason why this is generally bad, is you can't knock down a turf quest, like you can a building. You can't dismiss a turf quest like you can troops. So when it comes time to migration, if you're heavy on turf quests it can sometimes be the difference on a ranking spot in the new kingdom. Sometimes it can also be the difference on whether or not you have enough scrolls.<br> Now this isn't to say don't accept any turf quests. There are some that can be very helpful, such as the new Artifact Hall ones, you get free coins pretty much for opening chests. So if they can generally be worth it. However, pay mind to the quests you're opening and try to minimze the empty might you're gaining from opening them.</p>

<p><h3><u><strong>Building Might</strong></u></h3></p>
<p>Buildings typically have value of some sort. Something to offer to you at all times, whether its the ability to train troops in your barracks, or heal wounded troops in your infirmary. All the way to the Prison, Altar and Familiar buildings. Buildings don't generally give too much might, which is why Building Hells are so pointless, so don't worry too much about trying to minimze your might from them, because unlike with <strong>Turf Quests</strong>, you can demolish them if needed. Something to note however, if you are trying to build a very low might <a href="./trap.html">solo trap or rally trap</a>, then you may want to keep the amount of Resource Buildings you have down. If you've also completed all the familiars you want to work on, you can also knock those down. It's not a super large amount of might you will avoid, however it may help you look smaller than you are.</p>

<p><h3><u><strong>Research Might</strong></u></h3></p>
<p>Research is one of the biggest sources of might. There is some unavoidable research, often with high might attached to it, however there is also some research that is borderline pointless. <strong><u>The Defense Tree</u></strong> is one of those trees. There's not much that is offered by any of the research there, unless you want a big wall and traps. Truthfully, all it does it cost you more wall speeds in the long run. Other fairly empty researches are the Hidden Talent points, anything after Familiar Pact 4, if you do Tier 5 Troops, the Tier 5 Siege is generally a waste, and there's so many more, honestly. When it boils down to it though, it's about what you want, such as the extra Talent Points. Do I need them? Not at all, but with them I am able to gain a little bit more mixed attack stats. One last thing to consider with Research and Might, if you can avoid doing the 'pointless' ones for as long as you, do it. That way you have them if you ever need to do a Research event.</p>
